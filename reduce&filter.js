Using Reduce
Using the varabile persons
Create a function called avgAge
that accept an array
and return average age of this array

Ex: avgAge(persons) => 41.2
*/

2
Using Reduce
Using the varabile persons
Create a function called longestName
that accept an array
and return the longerst full name

Ex: longestName(persons) => 'Soso Al-Amora'
*/

8
Using Filter
**this question not that easy mybe you will need to use two function inside each other

Create a function called containChar
that accept an array of string
and return an array of these string that contain this char

Advanced Part {for your benefits}

Dont solve any question here if you didnt finish all the question a bove with your pair

This part you can try it
You should solve this part solo not with your pair

This part is extra (and there is no help from the trainer) it is good to try it
